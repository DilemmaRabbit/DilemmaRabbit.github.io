      <description>問題描述 分類： 🟠 medium 🟠 相關主題： Linked List, Math, Reservoir Sampling, Randomized 題目（英文） Given a singly linked list, return a random node&#39;s value from the linked list. Each node must have the same probability of being chosen. Implement the Solution class: Solution(ListNode head) Initializes the object with the integer array nums. int getRandom() Chooses a node randomly from the list and returns its value. All the nodes of the list should be equally likely to be choosen.</description>

      <description>問題描述 分類：🟠 medium 🟠 相關主題：Array,Sorting,Heap(Piority Queue),Simulation,Prefix Sum 題目（英文） There is a car with capacity empty seats. The vehicle only drives east (i.e., it cannot turn around and drive west). You are given the integer capacity and an array trips where trip[i] = [numPassengersi, fromi, toi] indicates that the ith trip has numPassengersi passengers and the locations to pick them up and drop them off are fromi and toi respectively. The locations are given as the number of kilometers due east from the car&#39;s initial location.</description>

      <description>問題描述 分類：🟢 easy 🟢 相關主題：Bit Manipulation  題目（英文） The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0&#39;s to 1&#39;s and all the 1&#39;s to 0&#39;s in its binary representation. For example, The integer 5 is &amp;quot;101&amp;quot; in binary and its complement is &amp;quot;010&amp;quot; which is the integer 2. Given an integer n, return its complement.  測資 Example 1: Input: n = 5 Output: 2 Explanation: 5 is &amp;quot;101&amp;quot; in binary, with complement &amp;quot;010&amp;quot; in binary, which is 2 in base-10.</description>

      <description>問題描述 分類：🟠 medium 🟠 相關主題：Counting, Hash_table, Array  題目（英文） You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of time[i] seconds. Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60. Formally, we want the number of indices i, j such that i &amp;lt; j with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.  測資 Example 1: Input: time = [30,20,150,100,40] Output: 3 Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60: (time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180 (time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120 (time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60 Example 2: Input: time = [60,60,60] Output: 3 Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.</description>

      <description>問題描述 分類：🟢 easy 🟢 相關主題：Graph, Hash_table, Array 題目（英文） In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge. If the town judge exists, then: 1. The town judge trusts nobody. 2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge. 3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2. You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi.</description>
